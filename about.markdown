I defended my PhD thesis in June 2021 at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, NTNU Trondheim, Norway. I worked on the numerical modelling of fluid-structure interaction including non-linear structures and complex free surfaces. In Desember 2023, I finished a bachelor degree in philosophy at the University of Oslo, Norway.

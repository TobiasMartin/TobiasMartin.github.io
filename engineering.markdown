I hold a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering and a Master of Science in marine technology from the University of Rostock, Germany. Early on in my studies, I was interested in the technological challenges concerning the interaction of floating structures and the ocean.

I am the original developer of the [WENO](https://github.com/WENO-OF) library which is an open-source implementation of weighted essentially non-oscillatory schemes in OpenFOAM.

In 2017, I enrolled in a Ph.D. program in environmental engineering at NTNU, Trondheim. I developed new numerical tools for improving the design process of mooring systems and aquaculture structures by simulating them in realistic sea states encountered in the ocean. After the successful defence of my thesis in 2021, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher on modelling the fluid-structure interaction of biological systems like seaweed farms and the ocean.

My doctoral thesis was titled *A new CFD-based framework for modelling the interaction of open ocean aquaculture structures and complex free surface hydrodynamics* and can be downloaded [here](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2758435).

A full list of my publications can be found on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tobias-Martin-5).

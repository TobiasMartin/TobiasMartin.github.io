This essay is about the topic of intrinsic value which is central to environmental philosophy.
I present possible arguments for and against the intrinsic value of non-human beings and argue that non-human beings have intrinsic value once ethics is placed on a proper ontology. In particular, I engage with the philosophy of [Freya Mathews](http://www.freyamathews.net/) who is a great inspiration to me.

This essay explores the interaction of systems of human agency with environments on the basis of the concepts of place and environing using Dovrefjell as case. I will argue that even though environing is suitable for revealing the culture-nature dichotomy, making sense of Dovrefjell needs to expand agency to the more-than-human world through acknowledging the sympoietic structure of the whole. Here, cosmologies as the underlying narratives play a significant role in writing cultural history beyond the dichotomy.

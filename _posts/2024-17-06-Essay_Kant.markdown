This essay argues that Kant’s conception of evil provides a relevant contribution to moral philosophy by excluding certain common views on evil. However, he only succeeds to a limited degree in explaining evil due to the lack of a formal proof of its origin and his moral psychology that tries to keep morality and freedom distinct from nature. I will then turn to the Freedom essay of Schelling to show that the conceptualisation of evil can be placed on a more fruitful ground if Kant’s dualism is relaxed. As such, the origin of evil reveals the inevitable difficulty of living as beings with freedom.

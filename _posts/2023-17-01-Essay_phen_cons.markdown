This essay explores phenomenal conservatism as an epistemological theory of justification which claims that what seems true provides immediate justification for our beliefs.

I will argue that phenomenal conservatism can secure external world foundationalism even if one questions the underlying assumption of most epistemological theories, Cartesian dualism.

In this essay, I argue that the positions of naturalism and normativism reduce disease to a static concept that represents an epistemological obstacle to the knowledge of 'normality' as well as an ontological obstacle to life’s supposed goal of maintaining some condition like survival fitness or flourishing. As an alternative,  I suggest a non-dualistic approach to disease that is ecological and thus, respects that the human organism is dynamic and intrinsically entangled in relationships with the ’other’. Thus, disease as an abnormal anormality contains restrictive norms that can affect individuals as much as multi-species symbioses or whole ecosystems.
